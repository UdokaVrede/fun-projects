To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.

animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.

@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of @keyframes and the animation properties:

#anim {
  animation-name: colorful;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}

@keyframes colorful {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}

by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards. The animation-fill-mode specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished. You can set it like so:

animation-fill-mode: forwards;

---->
When elements have a specified position, such as fixed or relative, the CSS offset properties right, left, top, and bottom can be used in animation rules to create movement.

As shown in the example below, you can push the item downwards then upwards by setting the top property of the 50% keyframe to 50px, but having it set to 0px for the first (0%) and the last (100%) keyframe.

@keyframes rainbow {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
    top: 0px;
  }
  50% {
    background-color: green;
    top: 50px;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
    top: 0px;
  }
}

--->
animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:

animation-iteration-count: infinite;

---->
the animation-timing-function property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time (your animation-duration), the animation-timing-function says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of the drive.

There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is ease, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again in the end. Other options include ease-out, which is quick in the beginning then slows down, ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end, or linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.
